# Feature Engineering  

This repository contains examples and techniques for feature engineering, focusing on improving dataset quality and enhancing model performance. It covers critical aspects such as **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Interquartile Range (IQR) analysis** for outlier detection and handling.  



## Features  

This repository includes:  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
  - Understanding data distribution.  
  - Summary statistics and visualizations.  
  - Insights into data trends and anomalies.  
- **Outlier Detection using IQR**:  
  - Identification of outliers based on the interquartile range.  
  - Strategies for outlier handling (e.g., capping, removal).  
- **Feature Engineering Techniques**:  
  - Handling missing values.  
  - Data normalization and scaling.  
  - Feature transformation and encoding.  



## Prerequisites  

Ensure you have the following installed:  
- Python 3.8+  
- Required libraries:  
  - NumPy  
  - Pandas  
  - Matplotlib  
  - Seaborn  

Install dependencies using:  
```bash  
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn  
```  



## How to Use  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/ashithapallath/Feature-Engineering.git  
   cd Feature-Engineering  
   ```  

2. Explore the Jupyter Notebooks (`*.ipynb`):  
   - Notebooks include step-by-step explanations and implementations.  

3. Run the notebooks using:  
   ```bash  
   jupyter notebook  
   ```  

4. Follow the instructions in each notebook to reproduce the analyses and techniques.  


## Techniques Overview  

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Summarizing data using:  
  - Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).  
  - Data visualizations (histograms, box plots, scatter plots).  
- Identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data.  

### **IQR-Based Outlier Detection**  
- Calculation of the interquartile range:  
  ```python  
  Q1 = data['column'].quantile(0.25)  
  Q3 = data['column'].quantile(0.75)  
  IQR = Q3 - Q1  
  lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR  
  upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR  
  outliers = data[(data['column'] < lower_bound) | (data['column'] > upper_bound)]  
  ```  
- Options for handling outliers:  
  - Removing rows with outliers.  
  - Capping values at lower and upper bounds.
